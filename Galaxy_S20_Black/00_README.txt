EMULATOR SKIN
-------------
The skin consists of background, foreground, and buttons/keyboard.


* BACKGROUND
	
	It is the gray curved image with the device positioned on the left.

* FOREGROUND
	
	The foreground is the image placed on top of the device screen to replicate device's notches, rounded corners, and punch-hole selfie cameras. 
If you wish to use the emulator skin without the foreground, just edit the ‘layout’ file and remove the lines below (Line 6-8):
	
------------------------------------------	
	foreground {
		mask	fore_port.png
	}
------------------------------------------


*BUTTONS/KEYBOARD
	
	These buttons and keyboards are just additional features that enable you to control the emulator skin aside from on-device buttons/keyboard.

NOTE 
The Galaxy Emulator Skin defines only the appearance and controls of an Android Virtual Device (AVD), which still runs on a stock Android OS.
